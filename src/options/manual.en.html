      <p>
        To use withExEditor, you need to prepare the host which executes your editor.
        You can get the host for withExEditor from <a href="https://github.com/asamuzaK/withExEditorHost" title="asamuzaK/withExEditorHost: Native messaging host for withExEditor">asamuzaK/withExEditorHost (GitHub)</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h1>Download the host</h1>
        <p>
          Download a zip file or tar.gz file of the source code from <a href="https://github.com/asamuzaK/withExEditorHost/releases" title="Releases · asamuzaK/withExEditorHost">Releases · asamuzaK/withExEditorHost</a>, save it in an arbitrary place after decompressing (for example, <code>C:\Users\XXX\withExEditorHost\</code>).
          If you have a Github account, you can also clone and save the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the host runs with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" title="Node.js">Node.js</a>, so if you do not have Node.js, please install it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that the host depends on the version of Node.js.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            withExEditorHost v1.x requires Node.js v6.9.5 or higher.
          </li>
          <li>
            withExEditorHost v2.x requires Node.js v7.6.0 (at this time) or higher.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Setting up the host</h1>

          Depending on your environment, you may need to run as admin.
